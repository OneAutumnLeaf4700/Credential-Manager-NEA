# Credential Manager NEA

This project is a credential manager application developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA coursework. It was made during the summer of Year 12 as my first attempt at programming a software application with a GUI in Python.

## Project Overview

The application is designed to manage and store user credentials securely. It includes features such as:
- Storing and retrieving passwords
- Managing user settings
- Encrypting sensitive data

## Motivation

The project was developed to fulfill the requirements of the NEA coursework, providing an opportunity to apply programming skills in a practical context. Despite being a first attempt, it laid the foundation for understanding software development processes and GUI programming.

## Future Plans

I plan to recreate this program sometime in the future, with my current programming knowledge just to see how much better i can make this.

## Getting Started

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and execute the `main.py` file.

```bash
python main.py
```
