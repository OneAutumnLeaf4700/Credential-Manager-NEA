## Project Overview

The application is designed to manage and store user credentials securely. It includes features such as:
- Storing and retrieving passwords
- Managing user settings
- Encrypting sensitive data

## Motivation

The project was developed to fulfill the requirements of the NEA coursework, providing an opportunity to apply programming skills in a practical context. Despite being a first attempt, it laid the foundation for understanding software development processes and GUI programming.

## Future Plans

I plan to recreate this program sometime in the future, with my current programming knowledge just to see how much better i can make this.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
